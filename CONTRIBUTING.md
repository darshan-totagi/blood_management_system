## 🌿 Branching Strategy

Use consistent branch names to make development clear:

* `feature/<feature-name>` — for new features
* `fix/<bug-name>` — for bug fixes
* `docs/<documentation-topic>` — for doc changes
* `refactor/<reason>` — for code cleanup / restructuring

Example:


feature/add-donor-registration  
fix/login-validation  
docs/update-readme  


---

## ✅ Commit Guidelines

* Use meaningful commit messages.
* Follow a simple, clear style, e.g.:

  * `feat: add new blood donation registration`
  * `fix: correct typo in registration form`
  * `docs: update README instructions`
* Use present tense and keep the first line short (max ~50 chars), followed by details if necessary.

## 🛠️ Running the Project Locally

1. Make sure you have the required runtime and dependencies.
2. Create any `.env` file or database configuration if necessary (depending on how the project is set up).
3. Run the application using the command the project supports (e.g., `npm start`, `python manage.py runserver`, or similar).
4. Ensure your local setup works before making major code changes.

*(Customize these steps based on the actual tech stack of the repository.)*
